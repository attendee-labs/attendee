The current approach of date-based versions like twenty twenty three dash eleven is causing confusion with our enterprise clients. They keep asking which version is newer. I've drafted an RFC and shared it in the engineering Slack channel. The main trade-off is that we'd need to maintain backwards compatibility for at least eighteen months per major version, which means more testing overhead. But I think the developer experience improvement is worth it. Can everyone review the RFC by end of week and add comments?"
