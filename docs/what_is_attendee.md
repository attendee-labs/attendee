# What is Attendee?

Attendee is an open-source API that makes it easy to create and manage meeting bots for platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Bring meeting transcripts and recordings into your product in days instead of months.

## Key Capabilities

**Recording & Transcription**: Automatically capture high-quality audio and video from meetings with real-time transcription supporting 50+ languages and automatic speaker identification.

**Scheduled Bots**: Schedule bots to join meetings at specific times or integrate with Google and Microsoft calendars for automatic meeting detection.

**Real-time Updates**: Receive instant notifications via webhooks when bots join meetings, transcripts are updated, participants join or leave, or chat messages are sent.

**Cross-Platform Support**: Same API works seamlessly across Zoom (with OAuth), Google Meet (browser-based), and Microsoft Teams.

## Why Attendee?

Building meeting bots from scratch requires months of work that can distract from building the application you want. Each platform has different APIs, authentication methods, and technical requirements. Zoom's SDK is low-level and complex, Google Meet has no official API support, and Microsoft Teams has unique requirements.

Attendee abstracts away all this complexity into a single, developer-friendly REST API. Instead of building meeting bot infrastructure from scratch, you can get started in minutes. And instead of paying for expensive options in the current meeting bot space, self-hosting Attendee reduces costs while giving you full control over your deployment and data.

## Advantages Over Competitors

**Complete Data Ownership**: Unlike closed-source solutions like Recall.ai, Attendee's open-source nature allows you to self-host the entire platform, ensuring all meeting data stays within your infrastructure. This eliminates third-party data access concerns and meets strict compliance requirements, such as those in the EU.

**Predictable Costs**: Self-hosting Attendee eliminates usage-based pricing models that can lead to unpredictable costs as you scale. You pay only for your infrastructure, not per meeting or per minute of recording.

**Full Customization**: With access to the source code, you can modify Attendee to fit your specific needs, add custom features, and integrate with existing systems without waiting for vendor updates or approvals.

**No Vendor Lock-in**: Maintain complete control over your meeting bot solution without dependency on a single vendor's roadmap or pricing changes.
