## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### **High Priority Risks**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Swift contribution rejected by upstream | Medium | Medium | Maintain minimal fork with only Swift storage difference |
| Webhook delivery reliability issues | Low | High | Implement retry logic and monitoring |
| Breaking changes in upstream during migration | Low | High | Lock upstream version during development |

### **Medium Priority Risks**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Performance degradation in new setup | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive performance testing in staging |
| Configuration complexity increases | Medium | Low | Detailed documentation and automation |
| Team learning curve for upstream patterns | High | Low | Training sessions and pair programming |
